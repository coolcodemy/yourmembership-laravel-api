### Usage

```php
<?php
...
use CoolCodeMY\YourMembershipLaravelAPI\YMLA;

class YourController extends Controller {

    public function index(YMLA $ymla)
    {
        // Array results
        $result = $ymla->call('Auth.Authenticate', [
            'Username' => 'email@examle.com',
            'Password' => 'password',
        ])->toArray();
        
        // JSON/Object result
        $result = $ymla->call('Auth.Authenticate', [
            'Username' => 'email@examle.com',
            'Password' => 'password',
        ])->toJson();
        
        // XML result
        $result = $ymla->call('Auth.Authenticate', [
            'Username' => 'email@examle.com',
            'Password' => 'password',
        ])->toXML();
    }
    ...
}
```
#### Notes on YourMembership session
You don't need to generate session for authentication as this package will do it for you. The **SessionID** is saved inside Laravel cache for 15 minutes.


####  Returning the RAW XML results from YourMembership
This will return the results as XML and set the return header to XML for the browser to properly print valid XML.
```php
...
$result = $ymla->call('Auth.Authenticate', [
    'Username' => 'email@examle.com',
    'Password' => 'password',
])->toXML();

return response()->xml($result);
...
```
